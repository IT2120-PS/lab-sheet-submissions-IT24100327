# Q1

# A train arrives at a station uniformly between 8:00 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. Let the
# random variable X represent the number of minutes the train arrives after 8:00 a.m. 
# What is the probability that the train arrives between 8:10 a.m. and 8:25 a.m.?

punif(25,min = 0, max = 40, lower.tail = TRUE) - punif(10, min = 0, max = 40, lower.tail = TRUE)

# Q2

# The time (in hours) to complete a software update is exponentially distributed
# with rate λ = 1 / 3. Find the probability that an update will take at most 2 hours.

pexp(2,rate = 1 / 3, lower.tail = TRUE)

# Q3

# Suppose IQ scores are normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard
# deviation of 15.

# i. What is the probability that a randomly selected person has an IQ
# above 130?

pnorm(130, mean = 100, sd = 15, lower.tail = FALSE)

# ii. What IQ score represents the 95th percentile?

qnorm(0.95, mean = 100, sd = 15, lower.tail = TRUE)
